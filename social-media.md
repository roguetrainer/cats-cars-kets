When AB ≠ BA: The Maths of Everything That Moves

Ever wonder what parallel parking has to do with quantum computing? Turns out, they're connected by the same beautiful maths - & I'm not talking about Schrödinger's cat.

The connection is the COMMUTATOR: [A, B] = AB - BA. When this doesn't equal zero, THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS MATTERS. Do A then B, and you get a different result than B then A. This "failure to commute" is what lets you slide a car sideways into a tight parking spot, helps cats land on their feet with zero angular momentum, and explains why quantum gates produce different states depending on their sequence.

Let's explore five domains where this shows up: 🚗 parking (SE(2)), 🐈‍⬛ falling cats (SO(3)), 🦾 robot arms (SE(3)), ⚛️ qubits (SU(2)), and 🧠 neural ODEs (Diffeomorphisms). Same math, wildly different applications.

Yet another connection: A falling cat uses GAUGE THEORY — the same framework that describes electrons in magnetic fields—to rotate in mid-air without violating conservation of angular momentum. Meanwhile, you're using LIE BRACKETS every time you parallel park, even if you've never heard the term.

🤔 Intriguing that your 🚗 parallel parking technique, a 🐈‍⬛ cat's acrobatics, ⚛️ quantum error correction, and the 🧠 architecture of neural networks are all dialects of the same mathematical language?! 

The central dogma: order matters. In CONTROL THEORY, QUANTUM MECHANICS, ROBOTICS, and DEEP LEARNING alike, [A, B] ≠ 0 creates motion in new dimensions. THE SEQUENCE YOU CHOOSE DETERMINES WHERE YOU END UP.

"Add the eggs after you cream the butter and sugar." 
"Don't put the cart before the horse." 

Sometimes the most powerful ideas in physics, AI, and engineering share a common ancestor. This one just happens to explain both how to park and how qubits work.
