## The "Commutator Zoo": Non-Commutative Geometry across Physics & AI

**The Central Dogma:** The order of operations matters. 

If $[A, B] \neq 0$, then doing $A$ followed by $B$ is different from $B$ followed by $A$. 
This difference creates motion in a new, often "forbidden" dimension.

### The Collection
Run the python scripts in each folder to visualize the math.

1. **Cars ($SE(2)$):** Parking sideways using Lie Brackets.
2. **Cats ($SO(3)$):** Falling and rotating using Gauge Theory.
3. **Claws ($SE(3)$):** Robot arms moving in 3D space.
4. **Kets ($SU(2)$):** Quantum gates on the Bloch Sphere.
5. **Continuous (Diff):** Neural ODEs and non-commutative flows.

See `OVERVIEW.md` for the deep-dive explanation of the math.
